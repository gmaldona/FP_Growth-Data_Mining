# Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm for Data Mining 

### Data Structures and Algorithms Project

**Project Overview:** The csv file [Groceries_dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmaldona/FP_Growth-Data_Mining/master/Data/Groceries_dataset.csv) contains customer ID and an item purchased on a date by that ID. The data can be sorted by each customer ID and then by data of purchase to obtain a receipt of the customer's order. The organized customer data is shown in the XML file [Transactions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmaldona/FP_Growth-Data_Mining/master/Data/Transactions.xml). With all the receipts organized, we can apply date mining techniques to find relationships within the data.

## <ins>Important Note:</ins>
Compilation and running of the source code can all be done by executing ```run.sh``` or in the terminal executing the command ``` ./run.sh```

For organization purposes, ```cleanup.sh``` removes *.class files generated by ```run.sh```

The Algorithm breakdown and explanation can be found [here](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/ch5_association_analysis.pdf).
